## 1.3 The Axiom of Completeness

*Every nonempty set of real numbers that is bounded above has a least upper bound.*

> Why there is no need to assert that greatest lower bounds exist as part of the Axiom of Completeness?

Let $A$ be nonempty and bounded below, and define $B=\{b \in R: b\text{ is a lower bound for } A\}$. Then $\sup B = \inf A$, proves the greatest lower bound exists using the least upper bound.
